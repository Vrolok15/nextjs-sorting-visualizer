## Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
My first Next.js project, and a way to visualize sorting algorithms. 

## How to use
- Click the "Generate random array" button to generate a random array of numbers.
- Click the various "Sort" buttons to sort the array.
- Use the slider to change the speed of the sorting algorithm.

## Thank you
To all sorting algorithm visualizers on YouTube, they inspired me to make this one.
